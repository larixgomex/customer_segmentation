### Customer Segmentation through RFM Analysis

Wolt, a popular online food delivery company, recognizes the importance of understanding its user base to serve its customers better. To achieve this, I'll create a detailed user segmentation based on the available data.

The dataset I'm working with consists of some machine-generated user data of a food delivery application. Each row represents a unique customer who has registered to use the service from September 2019 to October 2020. During this period, the customers might have made purchases from the app or not.

## Objective
To accomplish this goal, I'm performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. This analysis will allow them to segment their users into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, such as the frequency of orders, the amount spent, and how recently they placed their last order. By doing so, Wolt can identify its most valuable customers and determine the areas that require more attention to retain them.

The insights gained from this analysis will enable the company to tailor their services to meet the needs of different user segments. For instance, they may offer personalized discounts to users who have not ordered in a while, or they may provide a better loyalty program to their most frequent users.
